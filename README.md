# R_techniques
A personal library of techniques in R

I am not fond of R because I don't enjoy thinking in R or coding in R.
But R is both powerful and ubiquitous, so I maintain a basic comfort level
by poking around once in a while.  I realize that in taking on a serious
project, I'd have to hit the documentation and look for examples, but all
that is much easier if I maintain familiarity with the environment.

So here you go.
